# Detailed Item Description Style Specification  

### (Formatting Rules for DLC & Updated Items)

This document defines the exact text formatting conventions used by the **Detailed Item Descriptions** mod by *dziggy*, as extracted from existing modded entries.  
All autogenerated descriptions **must** follow these rules to ensure stylistic consistency with existing (pre-DLC) items.

---

## 1. Colour Codes (HTML `<font>` Tags)

These colours appear consistently across dziggy’s edited text:

| Purpose                                 | Color Code | Notes                                                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Passive Effect header                   | #C0B194  | Used for headers like “Passive Effect:” or “Skill: NAME”.         |
| Stat names (STR/DEX/VIG/etc.)           | #E0B985  | Always applied to stat words when referenced in mechanical lines. |
| Physical/elemental buff types (general) | #F395C4  | Seen in meat/pickled consumable buffs.                            |
| Fire-element labels                     | #F48C25  | Used for “Base fire damage:” labels.                              |
| Magic/frost labels (damage, buildup)    | #57DBCE  | Used for “Base magic damage (X): …”.                              |
| Frostbite headings                      | #9DD7FB  | Used for “Frostbite:” and frost buildup labels.                   |
| Category label                          | #E0B985  | Same gold tone, used for “Category: X”.                           |

General rules:

- Colour *only the label* or *stat names*, not the numeric values.
- Use `<font color="...">label</font>` with no trailing spaces inside tag.
- Colour codes are lowercase hex.

## 2. Global Structural Patterns

### 2.0 Caption vs Info

- **Caption** = lore-only. No mechanics or numbers. Use the existing lore verbatim unless you must remove mechanical sentences from it; never add mechanics here.
- **Info** = full in-game description: lore (first), then mechanical section per category. If lore already exists in Caption, do not repeat it in Info; keep only mechanics in Info in that case.

### 2.1 Lore vs Mechanics

- Keep all **original lore** intact and grouped together.
- Lore comes **first**, as a block of one or more paragraphs.
- **No mechanical information** should remain in the lore section.

### 2.2 Mechanical Section Placement

After lore:

```html
(blank line)
(blank line) <mechanical section>
```

Spacing matters.  
Dziggy consistently uses **two blank lines** before the first mechanical header *unless* a specific category uses a single-sentence mechanical block (see Talismans / Seals).

### 2.3 Numeric Conventions

- Always use **integers** for displayed numbers.
- Percentages shown as plain integers: `20%`, `30%`, no decimals.
- Durations written as: `for 30 seconds`, not “30s”.
- Hit-specific effects explicitly mention hit count (`first 3 thrusts`, `final thrust`).

---

## 3. Category Templates

Below are exact templates to follow when generating new descriptions.

---

### 3.1 Armour With Simple Stat Bonuses (e.g. Consort's Mask)

**Pattern:**

```html
[lore paragraphs]

<font color="#C0B194">Passive Effect:</font>
Increases <font color="#E0B985">stat</font> by N.
```

**Rules:**

- Use the "Passive Effect" header.
- Stat name appears in lowercase (“dexterity”, “vigor”).
- Only one mechanical line for simple stat bonuses.
- Do not add armour statlines, weight, sell value, upgrade info, or storage limits.

---

### 3.2 Talismans / Seals With Multiple Stats and a Penalty (e.g. Radagon’s Soreseal)

**Pattern:**

```html
[lore paragraphs]

Increases <font color="#E0B985">stat</font>, <font color="#E0B985">stat</font>, <font color="#E0B985">stat</font>, and <font color="#E0B985">stat</font> by N, but increases all damage received by M%.
```

**Rules:**

- **No header** (“Passive Effect”) for this category.
- Single combined mechanical sentence.
- Penalty phrased exactly as:  
  `but increases all damage received by M%.`
- List stats in plain English order, separated by commas.

---

### 3.3 Spells (e.g. Adula's Moonblade)

**Overall Structure:**

```html
[lore]

[plain-English behaviour description]

<font color="#9DD7FB">Status Name:</font> Standard status formula text.

<font color="#57DBCE">Base magic damage (component):</font> VALUE <font color="#57DBCE">Base magic damage (component):</font> VALUE <font color="#9DD7FB">Base frostbite accumulation (component):</font> VALUE <font color="#9DD7FB">Base frostbite accumulation (component):</font> VALUE

<font color="#E0B985">Category:</font> CategoryName
```

#### Spell Section Rules

**Behaviour description:**

- A short, flavour-neutral description of what the spell *does*.
- Written in plain English.
- No numbers in this first behaviour section.
- Do not add quest hints, locations, or spoiler text.

**Status sections:**

- Status heading coloured (`#9DD7FB` for frostbite).
- Follow dziggy’s exact wording for status formulas.  
  Example (Frostbite):

```html
Inflicts damage equal to 10% of <font color="#E0B985">maximum HP</font> plus 30, then increases <font color="#E0B985">all damage received</font> by 20% for 30 seconds.
```

**Damage / buildup lines:**

```html
<font color="#57DBCE">Base [element] damage (component):</font> VALUE <font color="#9DD7FB">Base [status] accumulation (component):</font> VALUE
```

**Category line:**

```html
<font color="#E0B985">Category:</font> Fire, Dragon Communion
```

---

### 3.4 Weapon Skills — Simple Buff (e.g. Determination)

**Pattern:**

```html
<font color="#C0B194">      Skill: Skill Name</font>

Mechanical sentence with:

* buff magnitude,
* timeframe,
* special cases.

Example:
Imbue your armament with energy, increasing all attack power for your next single attack with that armament within 10 seconds by 60%. This effect works for critical attacks as well.
```

**Rules:**

- Header uses the gold tone `#C0B194`.
- Header contains **indentation spaces** before `Skill:`.
- No lore for skills unless present in-game.
- Mechanical description is one or two sentences max.
- Duration written as `within X seconds`.
- If the vanilla/mod text does not include “Unique Skill” or “Chargeable” wording, do **not** add it.
- Do not add location/quest/spoiler notes or usage tips unrelated to the skill’s mechanics.

---

### 3.5 Weapon Skills — Multi-Hit / Per-Hit Effects (e.g. Blood Tax)

**Pattern:**

```html
<font color="#C0B194">      Skill: Blood Tax</font>

Spin around in a circle then rapidly thrust your armament forward 4 times.
Each of the first 3 thrusts that hit an enemy will restore 2% of your <font color="#E0B985">maximum HP</font> plus 25, and the final thrust will restore 4% of your <font color="#E0B985">maximum HP</font> plus 45 if it hits an enemy.
```

**Rules:**

- Describe hit count plainly.
- For lifesteal:
  - Use `% of your maximum HP plus X`.
  - Colour `maximum HP` with `#E0B985`.
- Combine first-N-hits into a single clause, final hit into another.

---

### 3.6 Consumables — Buffs (e.g. Boiled Crab)

**Pattern:**

```html
[lore paragraphs]

<font color="#C0B194">Effect:</font>
Reduces <font color="#E0B985">physical damage taken</font> by 20% for 60 seconds.
```

**Rules:**

- Use header “Effect:” in gold.
- Describe the buff magnitude and duration. No recipe, sell/store limits, or acquisition tips.
- If multiple buffs/penalties, list each on its own line.

---

### 3.7 Consumables — Damage/Projectile (e.g. Throwables)

**Pattern:**

```html
[lore paragraphs]

<font color="#C0B194">Effect:</font>
Deals fire damage in a small area and inflicts <font color="#E0B985">Fire</font> buildup (X) on hit.
```

**Rules:**

- Include element/status if known; omit if unknown (do not use “??”).
- No crafting material lists or location text.

---

### 3.8 Talismans — Single Effect (e.g. Focus resist)

**Pattern:**

```html
[lore paragraphs]

<font color="#C0B194">Passive Effect:</font>
Raises <font color="#E0B985">Focus</font> by N.
```

**Rules:**

- One line per mechanical effect.
- Do not include variant ladders unless the item itself lists them; keep to this item’s value.

---

## 4. Do / Don’t

- **Do**: Keep numbers concrete; if source shows “??” or missing values, look up the correct values (use the provided HTML or, if still missing, search online) and fill them in—never leave placeholders.
- **Do**: Keep spoilers/quest/location notes out of the description. Focus on “what it does,” not “where/how to get/when to use.”
- **Do**: Match the mod’s tone: concise, mechanical, with colour labels as above.
- **Don’t**: Add sell value, storage limits, crafting recipes, upgrade paths, or patch notes.
- **Don’t**: Add category-generic boilerplate (e.g., Physick mixing instructions) or UI statlines.
- **Don’t**: Invent “Unique Skill” / “Chargeable” lines unless present in the modded base examples.

```html
Inflicts damage equal to 10% of <font color="#E0B985">maximum HP</font> plus 30, then increases <font color="#E0B985">all damage received</font> by 20% for 30 seconds.
```

### 4.2 Bleed (template for future use)

> *(Not shown in samples but should match FromSoft mechanics; fill via parameters.)*

### 4.3 Madness / Rot / Poison

> *(Follow the same structure: label line → effect sentence → base buildup lines.)*

---

## 5. Spacing & Linebreak Rules

- Lore → **2 blank lines** → header or effect section (except talismans with single-sentence effect).  
- Inside mechanical section:
  - No extra blank lines between damage lines.
  - Blank line before “Craftable item.” notes.
- End of entry contains **no trailing blank line**.
